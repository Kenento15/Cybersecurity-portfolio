# Threat Hunting Playbook

This playbook outlines a step-by-step threat hunting process using SIEM and threat intelligence data. The objective was to detect lateral movement and persistence activities in a simulated environment.

## Objectives
- Detect suspicious PowerShell activity
- Correlate indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Identify failed and successful login anomalies
- Utilize MITRE ATT&CK for technique mapping

## Tools Used
- Splunk
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
- IOC feeds (AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX)

## Outcome
Documented hunt steps, detection logic, and response recommendations based on identified patterns.
