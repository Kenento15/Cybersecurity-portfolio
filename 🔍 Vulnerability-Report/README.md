# Vulnerability Assessment Report â€“ Web Application

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings from a vulnerability scan performed on a simulated e-commerce web application using **Nessus** and **Nmap**.

## Tools Used
- Nessus
- Nmap
- OWASP ZAP
- Kali Linux

## Scan Methodology
1. Performed reconnaissance using Nmap to identify open ports and services.
2. Scanned the web application using Nessus for known vulnerabilities.
3. Validated some findings with OWASP ZAP for contextual testing.
4. Classified findings using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).

## Top Findings

### 1. Outdated Apache Server
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Description:** The Apache HTTP Server is outdated and vulnerable to remote code execution.
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the latest stable version of Apache.

### 2. SSL Certificate Misconfiguration
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Description:** The site supports weak cipher suites and is missing HSTS headers.
- **Recommendation:** Enforce strong TLS configuration and enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Description:** Reflected XSS found on the search parameter.
- **Recommendation:** Sanitize all user input and implement output encoding.

## Outcome
- Created a detailed report with risk ratings and remediation steps.
- Shared findings with stakeholders (in real-world, this would go to DevOps or IT teams).
- Reinforced the importance of regular patching and secure configuration.

## Next Steps
- Schedule follow-up scans after applying patches.
- Implement a continuous vulnerability management process.
- Educate development teams on secure coding practices.
