# pfSense Firewall Rules Lab

Configured a pfSense firewall to control outbound traffic and enforce content restrictions across a LAN.

## Goals
- Block social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram)
- Allow essential services only (DNS, HTTPS, email)
- Create logging rules for denied access

## Configuration
- pfSense 2.7.1 virtual appliance
- Custom LAN firewall rule set
- Packet capture and rule testing

## Outcome
Successfully restricted access to non-business sites. Validated rule behavior through browser tests and packet inspection.
